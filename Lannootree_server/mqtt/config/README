Place your SSL/TLS server keys and certificates in this directory.

This directory should only be readable by the mosquitto user.

* = usqed by mosquitto 

* ca.crt
ca.key: This file is used when creating new server or client certificates.
* server.crt
server.crs
* server.key

First create a key pair for the CA
    openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

Now Create a certificate for the CA using the CA key that we created in step 1
    openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

Now we create a server key pair that will be used by the broker
    openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

Now we create a certificate request .csr. When filling out the form the common name is important and is usually the domain name of the server.
    openssl req -new -out server.csr -key server.key

Now we use the CA key to verify and sign the server certificate. This creates the server.crt file
    openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 360
